# ```D2: Blockchain Based Secure Donation System```
Our project, D2: Blockchain Based Secure Donation System (where D2 is the abbreviation of ***Donate Too*** ), focuses on solving the prevalent issue of misutilization of money that is collected for donations. Money that is collected for a good cause might not be utilized in the desired way. Also, there are situations wherein the third party that is responsible for transferring the money to the person might be fraudulent. Due to these reasons, people tend to take a backseat while donating money, even for a good cause.

### OUR OBJECTIVE
To build a safe, verified, and trusted system where people can support the society by donating money for their welfare without fearing if the donation is valid and being used for the right reason, they donated for.

- To verify all transactions using their digital signatures and keys.
- To eliminate the need for one organization to handle all transaction data by making it decentralized and accessible to everyone.
